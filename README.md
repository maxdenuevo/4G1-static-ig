First project. The idea is to replicate a given layout with HTML5 and CSS3. It should cover

- The basic structure for every HTML5 website.
- The <link> tag to import CSS Rules.
- Using Google fonts.
- Using the different selectors available in CSS.
- Working with boxes: border, padding and margins.
- Overflow.
- Using Flex vs Position vs Float vs Display.
